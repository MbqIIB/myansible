    On the first node, start the MariaDB with the --wsrep-new-cluster to create a new cluster:

1

	

[root@rhel1 ~]$ /usr/bin/mysqld_safe --wsrep-new-cluster

Let the command run in the foreground.

    On the remaining cluster nodes start the mariadb service as usual:

1

	

[root@rhel2 ~]$ systemctl start mariadb

    After the cluster has been fully formed, stop the mariadb on the first node by sending it a SIGQUIT (press CTRL + \ on the console).

    On the first node, start the mariadb service via systemd:

1

	

[root@rhel1 ~]$ systemctl start mariadb

Thatâ€™s it. You can check the status of each of the cluster nodes by running the following command:

1

	

[root@rhel1 ~]$ mysql -e "SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'wsrep%';"
